# qt-react
convert pyqt to react-js

This is not a production-ready library, just a proof-of-concept

Will inspect a running PyQt-Application and convert the layout to React-Components

DEMO: https://mikkeljans.github.io/qt-react/dist/index.html

The demo is based on the main window of Vortex-Pipeline - http://cph.hydralab.com/work/vortex
